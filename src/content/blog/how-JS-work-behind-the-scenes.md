description: This article will explain how JavaScript code is executed behind the scenes.

To know behind the scenes how JavaScript code gets executed internally, we have to know something called **Execution Context** and its role in the execution of JavaScript code.

**Execution context** represents an environment in which JavaScript code runs.
It has two components,

- **The Memory Component**
- **The Code Component**

The Memory Component is the part where all the variables and function declarations are stored as a `key: value` pair and the Code component parses the code line by line. It is also known as the **Thread of execution**.

Inside the execution context, JS code is executed in two phases.

- **Creation Phase**
- **Execution Phase**

Let us Understand this with the help of the following code:

```js
var num1 = 5;
var num2 = 2;
function sum(n1, n2) {
  return n1 + n2;
}
var newSum = sum(num1, num2);
```

## Creation phase

The following things happen in this phase:

- JavaScript code is scanned for variables and function declarations and the memory is allocated to them in the memory block.
- In the case of a function, JavaScript copies the whole function into the memory block but in the case of variables, it assigns `undefined` as a placeholder.
- In the above code, there are three variables named `num1`, `num2`, `newSum`, and one function named `sum`. So when we run the program the Execution context will look like this.

## Execution Phase

The following happens in this phase:

- The execution of code starts line by line from top to bottom and updates the value of function and variables stored in the memory component.
- In the case of our code as soon as it encounters `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 2`, it assigns respected values to `num1` and `num2` in the memory. Then it moves to the `sum function`. Since memory is already allotted to the sum function, the code moves to the line `var sum1 = sum(num1, num2)`, and `sum()` will be invoked.
- In the execution phase whenever a new function is called, a **new Execution context** is created in the code component.

- Again the same process of storing the variables as `key-value` pairs in the memory component and executing the code in the code component of the new execution context goes on.
- Here in our case, first of all, the variables `n1` and `n2` are stored in the memory part and a value of `undefined` is assigned to them.
- After executing the code line by line, new values assigned will be `n1 = 5, n2 = 2` in the memory component.

- After the return statement of the invoked function, **the returned value is assigned instead of undefined** in the memory component of the previous execution context.
- After returning the value, the new execution context is **destroyed** and control goes back to the previous execution context and it will look like as shown below.

## Call Stack

To keep track of all the execution contexts, the JavaScript engine uses **Call stack** also known as **Runtime Stack** or **Machine Stack**.

The call stack is a data structure that stores the current state of your program, including the location of each function call. It uses the [Last In First Out](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) principle. Each time a function is called, the JavaScript engine pushes a new entry onto the top of the call stack. When the function returns, the JavaScript engine pops the top entry off the call stack.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the call stack works in JavaScript:

```js
function firstFunction() {
  secondFunction();
}

function secondFunction() {
  thirdFunction();
}

function thirdFunction() {
  return "something";
}

firstFunction();
```

In this example, when the `firstFunction` is called, it calls `secondFunction`, which in turn calls `thirdFunction`. The JavaScript engine maintains a call stack that looks like this:

![Call stack](/assets/js-behind-scene/callstack1.svg)

When **thirdFunction** returns, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack, leaving:

![Call stack](/assets/js-behind-scene/callstack2.svg)

When **secondFunction** returns, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack, leaving:

![Call stack](/assets/js-behind-scene/callstack3.svg)

Thus when a function completes its execution, its context is removed from the call stack, and control returns to the previous context. This process continues until all contexts are executed.
